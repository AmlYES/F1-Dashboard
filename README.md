# F1 Dashboard

A modern React + TypeScript dashboard for Formula 1 data, built with Vite. This project visualizes race results, driver performance, and season statistics using official F1 data from [Ergast API](https://api.jolpi.ca/ergast/).

## üõ† Technical Approach & Architecture

### **Frontend Stack**
- **React** (with hooks and context for state management)
- **TypeScript** (type safety across components and utilities)
- **Vite** (fast development server and build tool)
- **Jest + React Testing Library** (unit and component testing)
- **Chart.js** (for data visualization)

### **Key Architectural Decisions**

- **Component-Driven Design:**  
  UI is split into small, reusable components (`RaceList`, `PerformanceVisualization`, `Pagination`, etc.) for maintainability and scalability.


- **Context API:**  
  `ViewContext` provides global state (e.g., list/grid view) accessible by any component.

- **Hooks:**  
  Custom hooks encapsulate logic for context and data fetching.

- **Testing:**  
  Unit tests are written for core logic and components, ensuring reliability and easy refactoring.

- **Data Fetching:**  
  Uses Axios to fetch F1 data from the [Ergast API](https://ergast.com/mrd/), with pagination and error handling.

- **Visualization:**  
  Race results and driver performance are visualized using Chart.js for clear, interactive insights.

## üìù Usage

- **Browse Seasons:**  
  Select a season to view all races.
- **View Race Details:**  
  Click a race to see results and driver performance.
- **Pin Races:**  
  Pin favorite races to the top for quick access (stored in localStorage).
- **Switch Views:**  
  Toggle between list and grid layouts.
- **Pagination:**  
  Long List Pagination for better experience.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development Notes

- All code is written in TypeScript for safety and clarity.
- Styling uses a single global CSS file (`styles.css`).
- The project is structured for easy extension (add new pages, components, or features).
- Tests are located in `src/tests/` and can be run with Jest.
